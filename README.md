# My STL

Custom wrappers over various C++ STL features.

## About

The main purpose for this library is simply to have more customizable containers than the regular C++ STL versions. I am making them for my own personal use, though you are, of course, welcome to use them too. However, I make no claims nor promises about any of the code in this repository; use at your own risk.

## Objective

My main objective with this library is to build in some commonly used (but for some reason, not included with the STL) methods, as well as some convenience features that can be found in some higher level languages, such as negative indexing for strings and vectors. Over time, I am be able to optimize these implementations, but for now, they will prioritize ease of use over performance.
