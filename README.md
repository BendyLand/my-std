# My

Custom implementations of various C++ STL features.

## About

The main purpose for this library is simply to have more customizable containers than the regular C++ STL versions. I am making them for my own personal use, though you are, of course, welcome to use them too. However, I make no claims nor promises about any of the code in this repository; use at your own risk.
